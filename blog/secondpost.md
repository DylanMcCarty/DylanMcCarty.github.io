## Questions

1. Something I wish to do with code is create a program that scans amazon with a set criteria to tell you which products have the highest likelyhood of being a good product that people will want to use. I'd like it to compare the items price to average online prices to see whether that product is drastically different from average prices.

2. I'm struggling with confusing instructions that can sometimes be difficult to walk through in my head.

3. I solve problems by trying to walk through steps slowly and visualize the problems being followed through to completion while visualizing what it will look like when I get it done.

4. Speaking aloud and trying to walk myself through the problem while I actively problem solve has proven to be very effective in helping to solve difficult issues.
