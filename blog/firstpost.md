Title: Dylan McCarty's Blog

this whole experience was very confusing probably because i'm a little slow but i got it!

I learned to use different things in markdown though 
such as 

- **bold** 
- *italics*
- `code`

# Questions:

1.  Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
      To be totally honest this was very intimidating and an eye opener 
      to my type of learning, my expectations were changed and tailored,
      but this is to say that it made me excited to conquer bigger challenges.

2.  What are you excited or eager to learn more about?
      Javascript and real programming language that will allow me to create
      fun programs as a hobby, that way I delve more into the passion for coding.
      The challenge of figuring out problems is a rush and a thrill when 
      I learn more about my way of learning and more about something I 
      believe will be useful in the future.

3.  What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?
      I am perfect for coding because I love foisting my lifeless body onto a problem
      and hammering that nail with my forehead until the board breaks in two, 
      the nail is bent, and I find out what was ultimately behind the board.
      Concrete.
      that nail wasn't going anywhere, but I will try my hardest and find a way ultimately.
