                    This article is far overdue, yet i believe more experience will provide better insight into this subject.
                    pseudo-code is a very import part of the process of walking yourself through the procedure you intend to 
                    design, as a result of this pre-programming process it will take what you know and what you're capable of
                    and expose gaps in what your knowledge, in a sense, pseudo-coding will triangulate the logic your sure of
                    while high-lighting the logic you're not sure of, this will establish a basis for what you'd like your code 
                    to look like, and how you're going to lay out the <strong>TRICKY</strong> process of fact finding and discovery
                    a crucial part of the process, it cuts down on wasted time and wasted man-power, similar to how a runner
                    might walk a track a couple times before running and complete stretches, they warm up and prepare for the 
                    stretch of preparing themselves for the real work, similarly if a runner were to run a track without stretching
                    their legs first and moving around in preparation for the sprint, they hurt themselves by not giving themselves the 
                    capability to coordinate themselves before trying.
