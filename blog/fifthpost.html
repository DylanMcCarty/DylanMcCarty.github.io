                    The number 1 thing that held me back this week was, truthfully,
                    the lack of pseudocoding and as a result of that lack of pseudocoding
                    I ended up with a very difficult week in terms of getting everything
                    working logically, the coding problems could have been easier to solve
                    had I pseudocoded more of the week.

                    One thing I'd like to learn more would be a fuller extent of what I can do
                    with bootstrap, bootstrap makes alot of styling incredibly easy and it's a
                    tool that I think is incredibly useful, I hope I get the chance to stretch
                    the limits of what it can fully do.

                    In-Person bootcamp is much better comparably, just having the priviledge to
                    work with my peers in tackling a problem has been overwhelmng in the best way
                    to talk through problems and be surrounded by smart people who challenge me
                    to be even better as well, it's challenging as well as rewarding to achieve
                    success alongside my peers.

                    I want to have control over my life, I progress in a direction and try to get
                    as best as I can challenging myself in many different ways, I want to ideally
                    be better the next day than the last day, I'm okay with waiting 60 years to be
                    the perfect version of myself if thats what it takes and this plays a part in
                    that in the long run, achieving success and happiness as a person is my why as
                    well as proving myself wrong and overcoming challenges that I never thought I would.
