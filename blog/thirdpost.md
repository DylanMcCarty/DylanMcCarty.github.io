1. My thoughts on HTML, JS, and CSS are that they all three compliment 
eachother very well making the process of using all three very seamless, 
javescript is definitely much more syntax heavy, while HTML is incredibly 
forgiving by its nature, CSS is more fun because once you understand
its basic premise making it work becomes incredibly easy and its mostly
about trial and error with CSS.

for fun and I have had lots of fun making it.


3. pseudocoding is incredibly helpful in outlining the way code will work that way 
when you start the actual coding, the code will follow a guideline to avoid 
drifting away from the ultimate purpose of the code or to make sure that the bigger picture
is always outlined so that you can do work in actionable steps
