    <h1> Fourth Blog Post </h1>
    <p> 
        1. It was helpful to be able to focus on going on my own pace, that inherently caused confusion and frustration
        as I dont know whether my own pace was fast enough.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. What hindered my progress would by the fact that it was remote, when it comes to learning I have a harder time
        making progress in content trying to understand it for myself,
        I learn better in an environment where I can collaborate and have people actively explain concepts to me 
        in person when I'm failing to follow along  
    </p>
    <p>    
        3. I overcame challenges by trying to reach out towards the end and get answers or help in understanding.
        It helped to force myself to go slowly almost in a way that may seem to others like I'm taking too much time,
        but the truth is that content that requires lots of information to be taken in at once is a difficult task for me,
        and drinking too much coffee helped me overcome challenges as well.

    <h2> It was a Rocky Start </h2>

        <p> 
            I just want to personally thank the 3 J's
            I know I started off rocky and hopefully that 
            didn't give the wrong impression of what i'm 
            trying to achieve, thank you for your patience
            and for helping me when I felt like I was 
            underwater. I took a break over the weekend
            to rest my eyes because I spent so much time 
            reading material and catching up, but im looking 
            forward to starting in person, hopefully I've learned
            enough to be caught up. 
        </p>
