                    I think Javascript libraries are easy to learn hard to mast due to them being so incredibly 
                    versatile, there are so many things that you can do and that as a result makes it a little
                    harder is knowing every little detail about how it works to a T, it's a delight to work with
                    though because of its ability to be so much quicker than working in javascript which has so 
                    many more things to do before one thing is done.

                    I dont really know about many other frameworks of libraries, but i would
                    like to learn what more frameworks and libraries look like so i can 
                    understand more about what frameworks or libraries do, they are interesting 
                    especially because of how powerful i can see that they are and how indispensable 
                    they are in speeding up workflow

                    The tools i'm most interested in using or more-over things i'm interested
                    in trying is creating an ai and using mini-max algorithms to create that
                    ai and i'd like it to be a passion project, the ability to create something 
                    that you could interact with in such a tangible way is something I can't 
                    resist the thought of.
