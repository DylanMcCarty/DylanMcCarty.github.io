                    The thing that helped me understand the development process was still un-ironically 
                    pseudocode, pseudocode is still something I've struggled with and it's difficult to 
                    contend with because it is incredibly useful to understanding how to develop well, yet
                    it feels like your falling without a rope if you're trying to work on it for long and
                    it's very hard to trust the time expenditure rather than getting hands on the clay

                    To me personally it means, writing code that is very readable, readable and self
                    documenting while trying to cut down on excessive code, ideally itd be readable 
                    code over short code, id prefer to give the ability to others to read what i've 
                    written compared to making it entirely efficient.

                    Being a good developer is related to the answer of my last question, being a good 
                    developer as i believe means collaborating well with others and adapting to a fast 
                    paced environment where tech is always being changed and developed, being a good 
                    developer in a sense means being intelligently aware of your ability to learn and 
                    making sure to always excercise that muscle.

                    I'd imagine the thing all programmers hate doing is banging their head against a 
                    problem until it's solved or going through the unfortunate pain of realizing you 
                    weren't beating your head against a "problem" what you were trying to do was simply
                    impossible the whole time and now you have to accept that you have to go in a 
                    different direction.
